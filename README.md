havent tested yet
originally for win 10 x64
hitsound manager for tf2
  allows to store all hitsound in one place and quickly connect it in game
currently supports any pcm wav files

in plans:
support x32 systems
support different audio formats (at least mp3)
editing files (oscilogram in progress)
supporting random hitsounds feature
  maybe auto updating in game (not sure, the only way i figured out how to do it could cause vac)
structure the code
